# USING-GEMINI-CHATBOT-IN-OUR-OWN-CODE
This repo demonstrates a simple chatbot built using LangChain and the Gemini API. It showcases how to integrate LangChain's powerful tools for natural language processing with Gemini's API for conversational AI, enabling seamless user interaction and providing dynamic responses based on context.

**This code helps to create an environment where we can use an LLM Model(gemini,ChatGPT,HuggingFace) into our codes**

Using these LLM models We can perform various prompt generations which helps us to develop more projects.
